## 📜 How to Play

1.  **Move**: Select your piece and move to any adjacent empty tile (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
2.  **Block**: The tile you moved **FROM** is permanently blocked (marked with an X). You cannot move there again!
3.  **Trap**: The goal is to survive. If a player cannot make a valid move, they **LOSE**. The last player standing wins!
